# 📊 AdventureWorks BI Project – OLTP to OLAP with SQL Server & Power BI

This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow using Microsoft's **AdventureWorks** sample database. It simulates how to transform raw OLTP (transactional) data into an OLAP (analytical) format using SQL Server and Power BI for reporting and insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Extracted raw data from the **AdventureWorks OLTP database** using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- Built a **Star Schema model** by designing fact and dimension tables
- Performed data transformation and cleaning using **Power Query**
- Created dynamic, interactive dashboards with **Power BI**
- Developed custom KPIs and measures using **DAX and M Language**
- Converted OLTP data structure into OLAP-ready datasets for business intelligence reporting
